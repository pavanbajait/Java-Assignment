What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

ans--


The problems of JDBC API that developer nedd to face are as follows:

We need to write a lot of code before and after executing the query, such as creating connection, statement, closing resultset, connection etc.
We need to handle transaction.
We need to perform exception handling code on the database logic.
Spring JdbcTemplate eliminates all the above mentioned problems of JDBC API. It provides you methods to write the queries directly, so it saves a lot of work and time.
Repetition of all these codes from one to another database logic is a time consuming task.


The above problems overcame by of HibernateTemplate are:

Various common functions are simplified into single method invocations.
HibernateTemplate, which is a Spring Template class, can simplify the interactions with Hibernate Sessions.
The exceptions will be caught automatically, and converts them into runtime exceptions.
The sessions of hibernate are closed automatically
