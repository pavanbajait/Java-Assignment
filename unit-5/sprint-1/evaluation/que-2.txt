1--Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate:
anss--
JPA--
	Java Persistence API (JPA) defines the management of relational data in the Java applications.
	A JPA is a specification of Java which is used to access, manage, and persist data between Java object and
	relational database. It is considered as a standard approach for Object Relational Mapping.
	JPA can be seen as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems. 
	Being a specification, JPA doesn't perform any operation by itself. Thus, it requires implementation. So, ORM tools like Hibernate,
	TopLink, and iBatis implements JPA specifications for data persistence.
	
Hybernate--
	A Hibernate is a Java framework which is used to store the Java objects in the relational database system. It is an open-source, 
	lightweight, ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool.
	Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. So, it follows the common standards provided by the JPA.
	Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool which is used to save the state of Java object into the database.
	It uses Session interface to create, read, and delete operations for instances of mapped entity classes. It behaves as a runtime interface between a Java application and Hibernate.

--therer are three layer according to 3 logical partition .

1.Presentation Layer(UI layer)

2.Business Logic Layer (Service layer)

3.Data Access Layer 


--a bussiness application will be devided into the logical partition depending upon the role played by each part.

--logical partition of a business application is known as layer.


Presentation Layer :- 
-----------------------

--it is set of java classes, which are responsible for generating user input screen and response page(output screen) is knwon as PL.

--this layer provides the intraction with the end-user.


Business Logic Layer/Service Layer:-
------------------------------------------

--programatical implementation of business rule of a business organization is nothing but business logic .
--a collection of java classes whose methods have business logic to process the data according to the business rule is known as SL/BLL.


Data Access Layer :-
------------------------

--a set of java classes whose methods r exclusivly meant for performing CRUD operation with the DB server is known as DAL.
