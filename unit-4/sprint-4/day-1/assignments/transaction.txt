2) Describe Transactions in sql with your own words.

Transactions & ACID Properties

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed (using one or more SQL statements) on a
database as a single logical unit of work.


Properties of a Transaction
The effects of all the SQL statements in a transaction can be either all committed (applied to the
database) or all rolled back (undone from the database). A database transaction must be atomic,
consistent, isolated and durable.
A database transaction must be atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. Bellow we have
discussed these four points.

Atomic : A transaction is a logical unit of work which must be either completed with all of its data
modifications, or none of them is performed.
Consistent : At the end of the transaction, all data must be left in a consistent state.
Isolated : Modifications of data performed by a transaction must be independent of another
transaction. Unless this happens, the outcome of a transaction may be erroneous.
Durable : When the transaction is completed, effects of the modifications performed by the
transaction must be permanent in the system.

When a transaction completes normally, a transaction processing system commits the changes
made to the data; that is, it makes them permanent and visible to other transactions.
When a transaction does not complete normally, the system rolls back (or backs out) the changes;
that is, it restores the data to its last consistent state.

Resources that can be rolled back to their state at the start of a transaction are known as
recoverable resources: resources that cannot be rolled back are nonrecoverable.


3) Create a table Bank with following field;
Name  Account Number Balance
Ram   ac-12123        50000
John  ac-w4123        60000
David ac-23134        10000

Transfer INR 10000 from Jhon’s account to David’s bank account
