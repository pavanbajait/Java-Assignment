Wildcard in Java Generics -

The ? (question mark) symbol represents the wildcard element. It means any type. If we
write <? extends Number>, it means any child class of Number, e.g., Integer, Float, and
double. Now we can call the method of Number class through any child class object.
We can use a wildcard as a type of a parameter, field, return type, or local variable.

Upper Bounded Wildcards
The purpose of upper bounded wildcards is to decrease the restrictions on a variable. It
restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a subtype of that type. It is used by
declaring wildcard character ("?") followed by the extends (in case of, class) or
implements (in case of, interface) keyword, followed by its upper bound.
Syntax:
List<? extends Number>

Lower Bounded Wildcards:
The purpose of lower bounded wildcards is to restrict the unknown type to be a specific
type or a super type of that type. It is used by declaring wildcard character ("?") followed
by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound.

Syntax:
List<? super Integer>
