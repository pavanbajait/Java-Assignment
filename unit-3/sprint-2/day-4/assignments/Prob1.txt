Q1) What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java? explain with an example.
Answer-->
In java, super keyword is used to access methods of the parent class while this is used to access methods of the current class
1)	“this”
'this' keyword points to the current object.
‘this’ keyword we can not use inside the static area.
Whenever it is required to point an object from a method which is under execution because
of that object then we use 'this' keyword.
Following 3 main job of this keyword:
1. Points to the current class obj.
2. Differentiate between local and instance variable.
3. Calling a constructor of a class from another constructor of the same class.

Example: -
	Pointing to the current class object
		
	public class Demo
		{
		//instance variable
			int x=100;
		
		void fun1(){
			//local
			int x=500;
			System.out.println("inside fun1() of Demo");
			System.out.println(this); //Demo@232323 current class obj
			System.out.println(this.x); // 100
			System.out.println(x); //500
		}
		

	public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			Demo d1=new Demo();
			System.out.println(d1); // Demo@232323
			d1.fun1();
			//System.out.println(this); //Compilation Error
		}
	




2)	“super”
super keyword in Java:
	The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to immediate
	parent class object.
	Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of parent class is created
	implicitly which is referred by the super reference variable.
	
Usage of Java super Keyword
1. super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.
2. super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
3. super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

Example1: referring to the immediate parent class instance variable:
	class Animal{
		String color="white";
	}

	class Dog extends Animal{
		String color="black";
		void printColor(){
			System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class
			System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class
		}
	}
	class Main{
		public static void main(String args[]){
			Dog d=new Dog();
			d.printColor();

		}
	}
