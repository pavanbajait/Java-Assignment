Q4) Explain the difference between Checked and Unchecked exception?
ans-->
1. Checked Exception: The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except
RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions. For example, IOException,
SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are called compile-time exceptions because these
exceptions are checked at compile-time by the compiler.
2. Unchecked Exception: The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as
unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at
compile-time, but they are checked at runtime. In simple words, if a program throws an
unchecked exception, and even if we didnâ€™t handle or declare it, the program would not
give a compilation error.
The RuntimeException class is the superclass of all unchecked exceptions, so we
can create a custom unchecked exception by extending RuntimeException:
