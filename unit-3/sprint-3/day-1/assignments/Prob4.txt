Q4 What is instance of operator explain with an example?
answer:-
The java instance of operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).
The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type.
It returns either true or false.If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.
instance of is a keyword that is used for checking if a reference variable is containing a given type of object reference or not. 
Following is a Java program to show different behaviors of instanceof. Henceforth it is known as a comparison operator 
where the instance is getting compared to type returning boolean true or false as in java we do not have 0 and 1 boolean return types.

ex-->

class Animal{
--
}
class Dog extends Animal{//Dog inherits Animal
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();
System.out.println(d instanceof Dog);//true
System.out.println(d instanceof Animal);//true
}
}
